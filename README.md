# Rust Sudoku Solver
This is a sudoku solver implemented in Rust. It currently supports a fairly simple back tracking solver. I plan to add smarter solvers in the future.

This is a learning project for me, as I have never used Rust before, so the code quality might not be perfect.

## Usage

Clone the repo and run:

```bash
cargo run --release
